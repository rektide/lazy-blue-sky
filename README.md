# Lazy Blue Sky datastore

Lazy Blue Sky enriches everyday objects with observables and promises. It aims to invert inversion of control: it grants the management capabilities of Containerized systems and Dependency Injection systems, except on top of native constructs instead of forging them out of native libraries or frameworks. It also aims to be damned small.
